# 🎨 My Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
Here, I share my work, my journey, and my deep passion for **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — the technologies that let me bring ideas to life on the screen.

## 🧑‍🏫 Inspiration & Mentorship

A big shout-out and gratitude to **Sir Aditya Srivastava**, whose guidance, patience, and insights helped shape my path in coding. His teachings have been a beacon for me as I explore and build.

## 🖼️ Featured Technologies (with visuals)

Below are some visual cues (or placeholders) representing the core technologies I work with:

| Technology | Description | Image / Placeholder |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **HTML** | The structure: building blocks of web pages | *(see image above)* |
| **CSS** | Styling and design: how it looks | *(see image above)* |
| **JavaScript** | Interaction, logic, dynamics | *(see image above)* |

You’ll often see them working together in my projects — seamlessly.

## 🚀 How I Code / My Process

1. **Planning & Structure (HTML)**  
   I start by structuring the content semantically with HTML5 elements (header, section, article, footer, etc.).

2. **Styling & Layout (CSS)**  
   Then I layer in styles — colors, typography, spacing, flexbox or grid, media queries for responsiveness.

3. **Interactivity & Logic (JavaScript)**  
   Finally, JavaScript brings the site alive: event handling, DOM manipulation, animations, and more.

4. **Iteration & Improvement**  
   I test across browsers and devices, clean up code, refactor, and optimize performance.
